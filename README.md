# Stock Price Prediction using TensorFlow

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict future stock prices using historical data. The implementation is done using TensorFlow in Python, and the model utilizes deep learning techniques such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze historical stock price data and make predictions for future prices using machine learning. We use TensorFlow to implement the LSTM model, which is well-suited for time-series forecasting.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical stock prices, which includes features such as Open, High, Low, Close prices, and Volume. You can find sample datasets from Yahoo Finance or Kaggle.

## Model Architecture

- LSTM-based deep learning model
- Sequence length: 60 previous days
- Layers: LSTM -> Dropout -> Dense
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Optimizer: Adam

## Results

The LSTM model can capture the trends in the stock price data and produce reasonable predictions. Visualization plots are provided in the notebook to compare real and predicted prices.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more features (technical indicators, macroeconomic variables)
- Use advanced models such as GRU or Transformer
- Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
